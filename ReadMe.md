### Basic Idea

You run the program and it outputs a weekly menu

Frequency setting. Each meal has a "date last had" vs cannot be had within a 3 week window. 

### MVP

Command line tool that outputs md file including ingredients

### Completed project

An online end point that could be hit from a url. Either a website or an AWS lambda function. 

A feature to allow for the addition of items to the menu. With or without ingredients.

A feature to allow for the removal or change of a menu item. Eg removing or updating ingredients, changing the rating system to increase or decrease the rotation. 

To be fleshed out

Special occasion flag? 


### Nuts and bolts: backend

Database with menu items linked to ingredients and a value for how many days each meal will last for. Another column for when it was last picked and also its rotation weighting.
